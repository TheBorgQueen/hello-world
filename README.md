assimilation

"We are the Borg.  We will add your technological distinctiveness to our own.  Your culture will adapt to service us.  Resistance is futile." 
We will not add your biological distinctiveness to our own as we are not truly mating; however, your contributions will be assimilated. 
 
Thank you for your time.
